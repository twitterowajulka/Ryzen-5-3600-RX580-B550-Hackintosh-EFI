Installation
------------

You may install the driver to to /Library/Extensions or use OpenCore to inject it. Keep in mind that this binary requires High Sierra or above.

Notes
-----

1. Although the driver reports support for MTU values up to 9000, any attempt to set a MTU greater than 4076 will fail due to network buffer architecture with AppleVTD enabled.

2. In case you are experiencing repeated connection drops with EEE enabled, please select a medium without EEE manually in order to resolve the problem.

3. If automatic medium election doesn't work or doesn't produce the desired result, you might want to select the medium manually.

Troubleshooting
---------------

- Make sure you have followed the installation instructions especially when you have issues with certain domains while the others are working fine.

- Use the debug version to collect log data when trying to track down problems. The kernel log messages can be retrieved with "log show --predicate "processID == 0" --debug" in Terminal. Include the log data when asking for support or giving feedback. I'm an engineer, not a clairvoyant.

- Check your BIOS settings. You might want to disable Network Boot and the UEFI Network Stack as these can interfere with the driver. ASPM control should be left to the OS.

- Verify your bootloader configuration, in particular the kernel flags. Avoid using npci=0x2000 or npci=0x3000. 

- In Terminal run netstat -s in order to display network statistics. Carefully examine the data for any unusual activity like a high number of packets with bad IP header checksums, etc.

- In case auto-configuration of the link layer connection doesn't work it might be necessary to select the medium manually in System Preferences under Network for the interface.

- Use Wireshark to create a packet dump in order to collect diagnostic information.

- Keep in mind that there are many manufacturers of network equipment. Although Ethernet is an IEEE standard, different implementations may show different behavior causing incompatibilities. In case you are having trouble try a different switch or a different cable.

- Disable Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) if the link gets lost frequently. It can be disabled by selecting a medium which without EEE support).
